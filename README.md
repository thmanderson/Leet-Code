# First Steps

This code written for practicing &amp; improving my work, by solving online challenges / problems.

## Starting point:

I've initially started by trying to solve the 'Easy' challenges from LeetCode.com. This started out as writing a simple console app to test, but I thought it would be better practice to make it as a library with unit tests instead.
